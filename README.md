## Description
The client wants me to ensure their website is accessible to people with disabilities.
I created this project to refactor their code and make it accessible.
Accessibility is very important as more people with disabilities rely on the internet.
People using assistive technologies like screen readers should be able to understand the content and meaning of websites.
I learned about semantic HTML and will use that to make this website accessible.
