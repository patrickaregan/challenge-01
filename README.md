## Description
- This project is about refactoring code that is given by a client to make sure it is
accessible to users with disabilities. The starter code is mentioned in the Credits.
- I want any code I work on to be as professional as possible and making it accessible
is one way to do that.
- Accessibility is important so people with disabilities can use the website.
- I learned about Semantic HTML and I will use that to improve the starter code.
